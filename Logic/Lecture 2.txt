Argument 
    Socrates is a Footballer
    All Footballers are bipeds
    So Socrates is a bipeds

Formulate - forms of sentences 

X set of Formulate
A formula 

X \ts A (sequent)

s - name (socrates) \\ 
F predicate - (_ is a bipeds)

F (s) -> Socrates is a biped

G (_ is older than _) -> Predicate with two gaps

G (s, p) -> Socrates is older than Plato

Atoms p,q,r

Connective p \and q
possibly _
_ although _ 
_ unless _ 
Trump believes that _

truth-functional connectives
    and ^
    not \not  
    or  \or
    if _ then _ ->

(p ^ q) ->
p -> (q - r)

((p ^ q) -> r) V (r ^ \not s) 

Scope -> Connective and the thing it connects 

((p^q)->r) V (r ^ \not s)

            ^-- Main connective 

A v B <- any formula with main connective is or 
(A -> B) v C <- 
(A ^ D), As are the same

((p^q) -> r) ^ p

Substituting a formula for an atom 
e.g. subst. s for p in ((p^q) -> r) V (r ^ \not s)
                        ((s^q) -> r) \or (r ^ \not s)
                        subst. s -> \not q for p 
                        ((s -> \not q) ^ p -> r) v (r ^ \not s)
                        subst. not r for s 

                        (((\not r -> \not q)^q)->r) v (r ^ \not\not r)
